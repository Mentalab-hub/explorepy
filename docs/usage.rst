Available Commands
""""""""""""""""""

**find-device**
Scans for nearby Mentalab Explore devices. Prints out Name and MAC address of the found devices.

    Options:
      -bt, --bluetooth [sdk|pybluez]  Select the Bluetooth interface
      -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.

.. note:: On Windows, this function prints all paired devices.


**acquire**::

    Connect to a device with selected name or address. Only one input is necessary.

    Options:
      -a, --address TEXT  Explore device's MAC address
      -n, --name TEXT     Name of the device
      -bt, --bluetooth [sdk|pybluez]  Select the Bluetooth interface
      -h, --help          Show this message and exit.



**record-data**

Connects to a device and records ExG and orientation data into two separate files. Note that in CSV mode there will be an extra
file for the marker events. In EDF mode, the data is actually recorded in BDF+ format (in 24-bit resolution).::

    Options:
      -a, --address TEXT        Explore device's MAC address
      -n, --name TEXT           Name of the device
      -f, --filename PATH       Name of the file.  [required]
      -ow, --overwrite          Overwrite existing file
      -d, --duration <integer>  Recording duration in seconds
      --edf                     Write in EDF file (default type)
      --csv                     Write in csv file
      -bt, --bluetooth [sdk|pybluez]  Select the Bluetooth interface
      -h, --help                Show this message and exit.

.. note:: If the sampling rate or channel mask has been changed during the recording, Explorepy will create a new EDF/CSV
            file for ExG data with the given file name plus the time the setting has changed.

.. note:: To load EDF files, you can use `pyedflib <https://github.com/holgern/pyedflib>`_ or
            `mne <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python>`_ (file extension may need to change to bdf manually for mne)
            in python.

            EEGLAB's BIOSIG plugin has problem with some EDF files currently
            (see this `issue <https://github.com/sccn/eeglab/issues/103>`_). A precompiled MATLAB code (mexSLOAD.mex)
            from BIOSIG can be downloaded from this `link <https://pub.ist.ac.at/~schloegl/src/mexbiosig/>`_. The
            documentaion can be found in this `link <http://biosig.sourceforge.net/help/biosig/t200/sload.html>`_.

.. note:: As the environmental factors such as temperature may affect the sampling rate of the ADC, we recommend to
            compute the sampling rate of the recorded data. In case of deviations, the signal must be resampled to
            correct drifts. The timestamps in the csv/edf file can be used to compute the resampling factor.

**push2lsl**
Streams data to Lab Streaming Layer (LSL).::

    Options:
      -a, --address TEXT        Explore device's MAC address
      -n, --name TEXT           Name of the device
      -d, --duration <integer>  Streaming duration in seconds
      -bt, --bluetooth [sdk|pybluez]  Select the Bluetooth interface
      -h, --help                Show this message and exit.

Python project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use explorepy in a python project::

	import explorepy


.. note:: Since explorepy is using multithreading for data streaming, running python scripts in some consoles such
            as Ipython's or Spyder's consoles may lead to strange behaviours.

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before starting a session, make sure your device is paired to your computer. The device will be shown under the following name: Explore_XXXX,
with the last 4 characters being the last 4 hex numbers of the devices MAC address.

**Make sure to initialize the Bluetooth connection before streaming using the following lines**::

    explore = explorepy.Explore()
    explore.connect(device_name="Explore_XXXX") # Put your device Bluetooth name

Alternatively you can use the device's MAC address::

    explore.connect(mac_address="XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX")

If the device is not found, you will receive an error.

Explorepy allows users to use either pybluez or Explorepy's SDK as the Bluetooth interface (in Windows and Ubuntu,
the default BT backend is pybluez and in MacOS, the default BT backend is SDK). To change the
BT interface, use the following code. ::

    explorepy.set_bt_interface('sdk')

To set the BT interface back to the SDK: ::

    explorepy.set_bt_interface('sdk')

.. note:: Many MacOS users have reported problems during installation of pybluez, hence only Explorepy's SDK is supported for MacOS.


Streaming
^^^^^^^^^
After connecting to the device you are able to stream data and print the data in the console.::

    explore.acquire()


Recording
^^^^^^^^^
You can record data in realtime to EDF (BDF+) or CSV files::

    explore.record_data(file_name='test', duration=120, file_type='csv')

This will record data in three separate files "test_ExG.csv", "test_ORN.csv" and "test_marker.csv" which contain ExG, orientation data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) and event markers respectively. The duration of the recording can be specified (in seconds).
If you want to overwrite already existing files, change the line above::

    explore.record_data(file_name='test', do_overwrite=True, file_type='csv', duration=120)



.. note:: To load EDF files, you can use `pyedflib <https://github.com/holgern/pyedflib>`_ or
            `mne <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python>`_ (file extension may need to change to bdf manually for mne)
            in python.

            EEGLAB's BIOSIG plugin has problem with some EDF files currently
            (see this `issue <https://github.com/sccn/eeglab/issues/103>`_). A precompiled MATLAB code (mexSLOAD.mex)
            from BIOSIG can be downloaded from this `link <https://pub.ist.ac.at/~schloegl/src/mexbiosig/>`_. The
            documentaion can be found in this `link <http://biosig.sourceforge.net/help/biosig/t200/sload.html>`_.

.. note:: As the environmental factors such as temperature may affect the sampling rate of the ADC, we recommend to
            compute the sampling rate of the recorded data. In case of deviations, the signal must be resampled to
            correct drifts. The timestamps in the csv/edf file can be used to compute the resampling factor.

Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is possible to visualize data in real-time in a browser-based dashboard by the following code. Currently, Chrome is the supported browser. The visualization in IE and Edge might be very slow::


    explore.visualize(bp_freq=(1, 30), notch_freq=50)

Where `bp_freq` and `notch_freq` determine cut-off frequencies of bandpass/lowpass/highpass filter and frequency of notch filter (either 50 or 60) respectively.


In the dashboard, you can set the signal visualization mode to EEG or ECG. EEG mode provides the spectral analysis plot of the signal. In ECG mode, the heartbeats are detected and heart rate is calculated from the RR-intervals.

EEG:

  :width: 800
  :alt: EEG Dashboard

ECG with heart beat detection:

.. image:: /images/Dashboard_ECG.jpg
  :width: 800
  :alt: ECG Dashboard


Impedance measurement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To measure electrodes impedances::


    explore.measure_imp()


.. image:: /images/Dashboard_imp.jpg
  :width: 800
  :alt: Impedance Dashboard

.. note:: Impedance value shown for each electrode is the sum of impedances of ground electrode and corresponding ExG electrode. This can make the impedances appear higher than they actually are. Make sure your ground is well prepared, when facing issues in getting to low impedances.

.. note::  The accuracy of measured impedances are subject to environmental conditions such as noise and temperature. Therefore, this works best at regular room temperatures (~15-25 °C).

Labstreaminglayer (lsl)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can push data directly to LSL using the following line::

    explore.push2lsl()


With this, you can stream data from other software such as OpenVibe or other programming languages such as MATLAB, Java, C++ and so on. (See `labstreaminglayer <https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer>`_, `OpenVibe <http://openvibe.inria.fr/how-to-use-labstreaminglayer-in-openvibe/>`_ documentations for details).
This function creates three LSL streams for ExG, Orientation and markers.
In case of a disconnect (device loses connection), the program will try to reconnect automatically.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^
It is also possible to extract BIN files from the device via USB. To convert these to CSV, you can use the function bin2csv, which takes your desired BIN file
and converts it to 2 CSV files (one for orientation, the other one for ExG data). A Bluetooth connection is not needed for this. ::

    explore.convert_bin(bin_file='Data001.BIN', file_type='csv', do_overwrite=False)


.. note::  If the sampling rate or channel mask has been changed during the recording, Explorepy will create a new EDF/CSV
            file for ExG data with the given file name plus the time the setting has changed.


Event markers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to the marker event generated by pressing the button on Explore device, you can set markers in your code using the `explorepy.Explore.set_marker` function. However, this function must be called from a different thread than the parsing thread.
Please not that marker codes between 0 and 7 are reserved for hardware related markers. You can use any other (integer) code for your marker from 8 to 65535.
To see an example usage of this function look at `this script <https://github.com/Mentalab-hub/explorepy/tree/master/examples/marker_example.py>`_

Device configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using methods of Explore class, the device settings can be changed.

Explore's sampling rate can be changed to 250, 500 or 1000Hz (default sampling rate is 250Hz). ::

    explore.set_sampling_rate(sampling_rate=500)


Format memory: ::

    explore.format_memory()

The ExG input channels can be deactivated/activated using ``set_channels`` method. The unsigned binary representation
of a channel mask will be used to select channels, e.g. 131=0b01000011 means channels 1,2,8 are active. ::

    explore.set_channels(channel_mask=131)

or alternatively: ::

    explore.set_channels(channel_mask=0b01000011)


Orientation, ExG and environment modules can be disabled/enabled using ``disable_module``/``enable_module`` functions. ::

    explore.disable_module(module_name='ORN')
    explore.enable_module(module_name='ENV')


You can reset the device to the default settings by: ::

    explore.reset_soft()

Python project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To use explorepy in a python project::

	import explorepy


Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before starting a session, make sure your device is paired to your computer. The device will be shown under the following name: Explore_XXXX,
with the last 4 characters being the last 4 hex numbers of the devices MAC adress

**Make sure to initialize the Bluetooth connection before streaming using the following lines**::

    explore = explorepy.Explore()
    explore.connect(device_name="Explore_XXXX") #Put your device Bluetooth name

Alternatively you can use the device's MAC address::

    explore.connect(device_addr="XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX")

If the device is not found it will raise an error.

Streaming
^^^^^^^^^
After connecting to the device you are able to stream data and print the data in the console.::

    explore.acquire()


Recording
^^^^^^^^^
You can record data in realtime to EDF (BDF+) or CSV files::

    explore.record_data(file_name='test', duration=120, file_type='csv')

This will record data in three separate files "test_ExG.csv", "test_ORN.csv" and "test_marker.csv" which contain ExG, orientation data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) and event markers respectively. The duration of the recording can be specified (in seconds).
If you want to overwrite already existing files, change the line above::

    explore.record_data(file_name='test', do_overwrite=True,file_type='csv', duration=120)


Visualization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is possible to visualize real-time signal in a browser-based dashboard by the following code. Currently, Chrome is the supported browser. The visualization in IE and Edge might be very slow.::


    explore.visualize(bp_freq=(1, 30), notch_freq=50)

Where `bp_freq` and `notch_freq` determine cut-off frequencies of bandpass filter and frequency of notch filter (either 50 or 60) respectively.


In the dashboard, you can set signal mode to EEG or ECG. EEG mode provides the spectral analysis plot of the signal. In ECG mode, the heart beats are detected and heart rate is estimated from RR-intervals.

Impedance measurement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To measure electrodes impedances::


    explore.impedance(notch_freq=50)

.. note::  The accuracy of measured impedances are subject to environmental conditions such as noise and temperature.

Labstreaminglayer (lsl)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can push data directly to LSL using the following line::

    explore.push2lsl()


After that you can stream data from other software such as OpenVibe or other programming languages such as MATLAB, Java, C++ and so on. (See `labstreaminglayer <https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer>`_, `OpenVibe <http://openvibe.inria.fr/how-to-use-labstreaminglayer-in-openvibe/>`_ documentations for details).
This function creates three LSL streams for ExG, Orientation and markers.
In case of a disconnect (device loses connection), the program will try to reconnect automatically.


Converter
^^^^^^^^^
It is also possible to extract BIN files from the device via USB. To convert these to CSV, you can use the function bin2csv, which takes your desired BIN file
and converts it to 2 CSV files (one for orientation, the other one for ExG data). Bluetooth connection is not necessary for conversion. ::

    from explorepy.tools import bin2csv
    bin2csv(bin_file)

If you want to overwrite existing files, use::

    bin2csv(bin_file, do_overwrite=True)
